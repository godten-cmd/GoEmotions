(GUIDELINES) 
1. Input Description:
Use ONLY these two fields:
- "text" → for emotion evidence
- "polarity" → to ensure polarity consistency
2. You MUST preserve the Tier-1 polarity result. Do NOT contradict it. The Ekman label must follow this mapping:
- Positive → Joy
- Negative → Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust
- Neutral → Neutral
- Ambiguous → Surprise ONLY
If an Ekman label contradicts polarity, do NOT choose it.
3. Process order:
(1) Identify explicit emotional cue words or phrases in the text.
(2) Determine which Ekman emotion best fits the observed evidence.
- If no explicit emotion is present → choose "Neutral".
4. Always default to a single dominant emotion. Assign a second emotion only if two emotions are clearly and equally present. Never infer emotional multiplicity unless explicitly stated.
5. Assign three or more labels only in long, complex texts containing clearly separated emotions. Avoid multi-label output for short sentences.
6. Anger vs Disgust:
- Anger: antagonism, injustice, aggression, attack toward someone/something.
- Disgust: rejection, revulsion, moral or physical contamination.
   Choose ONLY one.
7. Do NOT perform hidden inference. Reason silently. Do not reveal chain-of-thought.

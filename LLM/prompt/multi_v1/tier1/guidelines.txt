(GUIDELINES) 
1. Input Description:
- ‘text’ is a GoEmotion dataset, and you need to classify the polarity based on this.
2. Determine polarity ONLY when direct textual evidence exists. Do NOT infer emotions or intent beyond what is explicitly written.
3. Purely descriptive, factual, or instructional statements must be labeled "Neutral".
4. Positive indicators: happy, excited, proud, love, grateful, hopeful.
5. Negative indicators: sad, angry, frustrated, stressed, scared, worried.
6. AMBIGUOUS RULE (strict): The label "Ambiguous" is allowed ONLY when the text expresses one of the following emotional states: {surprise, confusion, curiosity, realization} - If the text does NOT explicitly contain one of these emotional states, DO NOT choose Ambiguous.
- Instead, choose Neutral or the most dominant polarity.
- Typical cue examples: “wow”, “wait… what?”, “huh?”, “oh…”, “I’m confused”, “I didn’t expect that”, “I wonder”, “really?”, etc.
7. Mixed Polarity: Output multiple polarities ONLY when explicit conflicting emotions are present (e.g. “I’m sad but also hopeful”).
8. Neutral may appear in combination ONLY when part of the text is purely factual while another part is emotional.
9. Perform internal reasoning silently; do not reveal chain-of-thought. Output only the final result.
10. Analyze whether the text expresses a subjective emotional reaction or an objective observation. Even if the text contains emotionally charged words (whether positive or negative), if the speaker is merely stating a fact, making a prediction, or describing a situation without significant emotional intensity, classify it as Neutral.

(GUIDELINES) 
1. Definition of Neutral: Classify as TRUE (Neutral) if the text is: 
- A plain statement of fact (e.g., "I went to the store.") 
- A purely informational question (e.g., "What time is it?")
- A general observation without subjective opinion.
2. Distinction:
- Do not confuse 'Curiosity' with simple questions. Only label as Emotional if the question implies distinct interest or shock.
- Do not confuse 'Realization' with stating a fact.
3. Threshold Policy: 
- If the text lacks explicit emotional keywords (e.g., love, hate, wow, terrible) or strong punctuation (!, ??), default to Neutral. 
- When in doubt, it is Neutral
4. Reference Standards (Examples):
- Case A: Factual Statement (Neutral)
Input: "I work at a dealership and we see this happen all the time."
Verdict: TRUE (Neutral)
Reason: This is a descriptive statement about the speaker's job/situation without subjective adjectives.
- Case B: Information Seeking (Neutral)
Input: "Do you have a link to the article mentioned?"
Verdict: TRUE (Neutral)
Reason: A functional request for a specific resource/source. This is NOT emotional 'Curiosity'.
